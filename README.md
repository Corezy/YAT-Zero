<img width="1167" alt="2025-02-28_22-30-21" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9263fd56-4132-4c87-9433-5c763e6e6c58" />

With all the excellent triple-belted z-gantry [3D Printers for Ants](https://3dprintersforants.com) available, I couldn't decide which one I wanted to use on my V0 because each had features I wanted, but none had all, so I set out to model yet another tri-zero build. thus the name YAT-Zero (YAT0).

**Design Goals:**
* Belted triple Z-axis - MET
* Three (3) Z Linear Rails - MET
* Additional X & Y travel for optional probes and nozzle cleaners - MET (142mm X, 123mm Y, 120mm Z)
* Room for electronics both in the rear and under the printer - MET
* Choice of Nema 17 or Nema 14 pancake motor for Z drives - MET
* Full travel while constraining the toolhead within the boundaries of the frame - MET
* Integrated nozzle wiper/cleaner without requiring a servo - IN PROGRESS
* Integrated purge chute - IN PROGRESS
* Boxed or unboxed configurations - MET
* Use as many parts from a stock V0.x - MET

This build contains parts from many different printers and some custom or remixed parts. Please see the long list of parts that were either 1:1, repurposed, or remixed. Thank you to all who created the originals.
