# YAT-Zero
**YAT-Zero (Yet Another Tri Zero - YAT0) printer variant**

With all the excellent triple-belted z-gantry ant farm printers available, I couldn't decide which one I wanted to use on my V0 because each had features I wanted, but none had all, so I set out to model yet another tri-zero build. thus the name YAT-Zero (YAT0).

**Features adapted from other builds:**
* Single rear Z extrusion linear rail and stepper mount
* Dual front Z linear rails & stepper mounts
* KGLM bearings for bed
* Extrusionless X-gantry
* Wagos bed mount
* AntHead tool head
* Papilio Lite Extruder
* V0.2 styled skirt

This build contains a mix of parts from many different printers and some custom or remixed parts. Please see the long list of parts that either used 1:1, were repurposed, or were remixed. Thank you to all who created the originals.

**NOTE: This is a work in progress and still needs some work.**  Know CAD and want to contribute? Contact me on the [Doomcube Discord](https://discord.gg/vXzRSne2).
