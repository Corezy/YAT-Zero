With all the excellent triple-belted z-gantry [3D Printers for Ants](https://3dprintersforants.com) available, I couldn't decide which one I wanted to use on my V0 because each had features I wanted, but none had all, so I set out to model yet another tri-zero build. thus the name YAT-Zero (YAT0).

This build contains a mix of parts from many different printers and some custom or remixed parts. Please see the long list of parts that either used 1:1, were repurposed, or were remixed. Thank you to all who created the originals.
